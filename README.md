Welcome to TestProject
======================
by [@RyanDantzler][1]
This is only a test project
-----
Had this been a real project it would have had contained the following:
- something cool
- real code examples
- a detailed readme file
- multiple sections
- something else im not thinking of

> Why this needed to be made

This project was to help me get a grasp of GitHub and creating a readme document in markdown language.

### Mission Accomplished!
